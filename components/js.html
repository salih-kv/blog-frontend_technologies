            JavaScript is a programming language. Many of these are related to
            the way, JavaScript is often executed directly in a client's browser
            commonly utilized in web development. It was originally developed by
            Netscape as a way to feature dynamic and interactive elements to
            websites. JavaScript is influenced by Java with the similar syntax
            of C. JavaScript conforms to the ECMAScript specifications which
            were developed by Sun Microsystems.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            JavaScript may be a client-side scripting language, which suggests
            the ASCII text file is processed by the client's browser instead of
            on the online server. This can load the webpage without
            communicating with the main server by the help of JavaScript. For
            example, a JavaScript function may check an internet form before
            it’s submitted to make sure all the specified fields are filled out.
            The JavaScript code can produce an error message before any
            information is really transmitted to the server.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            Like server-side scripting languages, like PHP and ASP, JavaScript
            code are often inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. The
            output of the server-side is displayed in the HTML but the
            JavaScript code remains visible in the source of the webpage. The
            file can be a separate “.js” file, which can be displayed in the
            browser.

            JavaScript has some advantages and disadvantages. JavaScript is
            often executed directly on a client's browser. JavaScript can also
            have the same benefits as server-side languages.
          </p>
          <!-- ^Advantages -->
          <h2 class="sub-heading fw-semibold">Advantages</h2>
          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i> Regardless of where you host
            JavaScript, it always gets executed on client environment to save
            lots of a bandwidth and make execution process fast.
          </p>

          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i> In JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest is
            an important object that was designed by Microsoft. The object call
            made by XMLHttpRequest as a asynchronous HTTP request to the server
            to transfer the data to both sides without reloading the page

          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i> The biggest advantage to
            JavaScript having a ability to support all modern browsers and
            produce an equivalent result.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i> Global companies support
            community development by creating projects that are important. An
            example is Google (created Angular framework) or Facebook (created
            the React.js framework).

          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i> There are many open source

          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i> It is not difficult to start
            working in JavaScript. For this reason, many of us prefer to start
            their adventure with the IT sector from learning this language.

          <p class="post-text">

          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i>Executed on the client-side, which
            makes it susceptible to security threats such as cross-site

          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i>JavaScript behavior can vary
            across different web browsers, leading to compatibility problems and
            the need for additional testing and debugging.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i>JS is a dynamically typed
            language, which means that variable types can change during runtime.
            This can lead to unexpected errors and make code maintenance more
            challenging.
          </p>
          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i>Debugging can be complex,
            especially in large codebases. Lack of comprehensive debugging tools
            and poor error reporting can make it difficult to identify and fix
            issues.

          <p class="post-text">
            <i class="bx bxs-right-arrow"></i>For security reasons, JS
            has limited access to system resources such as the file system,
